## Setup

**Setup parameters.yml**

Next, look at the configuration and make any adjustments you
need (like `database_password`).

**go to terminal & run**
```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Setup the Database**

Again, make sure `app/config/parameters.yml` is setup
for your computer. Then, create the database and the
schema!

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but the built-in web server works
great:

```
php bin/console server:run
```

Now check out the site at `http://localhost:8000`
